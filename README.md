# Privacy Micro-Lending Platform

A revolutionary P2P micro-lending platform built on blockchain technology, providing **confidential lending** with **privacy-first** architecture using fully homomorphic encryption (FHE).

## 🔒 Core Concept

**Privacy Micro-Lending - Confidential P2P Lending**

This platform enables peer-to-peer micro-loans while keeping sensitive financial data completely private. Using advanced cryptographic techniques, borrowers can request loans and lenders can provide funding without revealing actual credit scores, loan amounts, or interest rates to unauthorized parties.

## 🌟 Key Features

### Privacy-First Architecture
- **Encrypted Credit Scores**: Credit scores are encrypted on-chain using FHE technology
- **Confidential Loan Terms**: Loan amounts and interest rates remain private
- **Selective Disclosure**: Borrowers control who can view their loan details
- **Zero-Knowledge Lending**: Lenders can assess risk without seeing raw data

### Blockchain-Powered Security
- **Smart Contract Automation**: Automated loan processing and repayment
- **Immutable Records**: All transactions permanently recorded on Ethereum
- **Trustless System**: No intermediaries required for loan agreements
- **Transparent Disputes**: Fair resolution through blockchain verification

### User-Friendly Interface
- **MetaMask Integration**: Seamless wallet connection and transaction signing
- **Real-time Updates**: Live transaction status and confirmation tracking
- **Intuitive Design**: Easy-to-use interface for both borrowers and lenders
- **Multi-Network Support**: Works on Sepolia testnet and local development networks
